The system, called ClimateAI, uses deep learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of environmental data from satellites, weather stations, and ocean sensors. Initial tests show the system can forecast temperature and precipitation patterns up to six months in advance with 95% accuracy. The research team, led by Dr. Sarah Chen, believes this breakthrough could revolutionize how we prepare for and respond to climate-related disasters. The system has already been tested in collaboration with the National Weather Service and has shown promising results in predicting extreme weather events. Climate scientists worldwide are calling this development a game-changer for climate science and disaster preparedness.""",

    ### About
    This summarizer uses transformer models fine-tuned for news summarization:
    - **BART**: Best for general news articles and longer content
    - **T5**: Excellent for technical articles and structured content
    
    Quality scores are calculated using ROUGE metrics comparing the summary to reference patterns.
    
    For API access, the FastAPI service runs on port 7000 with endpoints:
    - `POST /summarize` - Summarize text
    - `GET /health` - Health check
    - `GET /models` - Available models
